          <p>
            Daren Duffie likes to introduce himself in many different ways. In
            most situations, he is just Daren, a 24-year-old guy who likes to
            spend time with his friends and chill. When he wants to build a
            community working as an artist and help people come together, he
            goes by Billfromtheville. The name is a reference to Brownsville,
            the Brooklyn neighborhood where he grew up, raised by a foster
            family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interested in multiple forms of art as a kid, Daren got into rap as
            a teenager and now uses his music to deal with trauma and release
            aggression in his own way. That's when everyone gets to meet
            BillTheDemon, the character who mixes drill beats with a guttural
            voice inspired by the legendary DMX to express his feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            “BillTheDemon tries to let people know that if you're ever in pain,
            just let that shit out,” he said before a studio session in Crown
            Heights. “When I was going through a lot of things in my life, [my
            therapist] told me to scream in a pillow when I get angry … That
            would get so much out of me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Billfromtheville classifies his music as metal/rage/drill and he's
            currently working on his first mixtape. Though fame hasn't come yet,
            he looks for other ways to make an impact with his music, even just
            for his immediate community of friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            For BillTheDemon (and Daren from Brownsville), music is therapy: a
            way to get from what he calls a negative space to a creative zone.
