          <h1>A Star Behind The Lens</h1>
          <p>
            Borleone is a videographer from The Bronx, responsible for several
            of New York drill's most popular music videos. Borleone honed his
            skills behind the camera shooting videos for artists like Harlem's
            Fergie Baby after studying mass communications in college.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, he came into prominence in the NY drill scene, becoming
            known for his collaborations with Bronx rapper Lee Drilly such as
            “Deadly” and “Public Service Announcement,” each of which have since
            garnered over one million views on YouTube. Borleone also works for
            HOT 97, where he shoots a variety of content, including many of the
            esteemed radio station's famous freestyle videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now highly in demand across the boroughs, Borleone uses the lessons
            he learned from his own upbringing to relate to the artists he works
            with. While he expresses some reservations about promoting the more
            controversial aspects of drill, Borleone ultimately believes he
            produces value by helping artists create visual expressions of their
            challenging realities.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Any kid that's coming up and saying 'damn, I wish I could do that'
            … You can look at me as an example,” said Borleone. “There's
            somebody who literally grew up the same way.”
