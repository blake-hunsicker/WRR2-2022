          <h1>A Star Behind The Lens</h1>
          <p>
            Borleone is a videographer from The Bronx, responsible for several
            of New York drill's most popular music videos. Borleone honed his
            skills behind the camera shooting videos for artists like Harlem's
            Fergie Baby after studying mass communications in college.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, he came into prominence in the NY drill scene, becoming
            known for his collaborations with Bronx rapper Lee Drilly such as
            “Deadly” and “Public Service Announcement,” each of which have since
            garnered over one million views on YouTube. Borleone also works for
            HOT 97, where he shoots a variety of content, including many of the
            esteemed radio station's famous freestyle videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to drill, Borleone says there's a limit to how far
            diss tracks can take an artist - even if the lyrics are simply a
            reflection of the rapper's “real.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If I see dissing and if I see opps all day … I'm gonna go to the
            studio and rap about what I hear and talk about all day,” Borleone
            explained. “But it's a cap to where you can get with just this kind
            of music.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While he has some reservations about promoting the more
            controversial aspects of drill, Borleone ultimately believes he
            produces value by helping artists create visual expressions of their
            challenging realities. Now highly in demand across the boroughs,
            Borleone uses the lessons he learned from his own upbringing to
            relate to the artists he works with.
