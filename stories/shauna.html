          <p>
            Shauna James reps East Flatbush everywhere she goes. Now a digital
            marketing manager at Atlantic Records, Shauna often attributes her
            success to her Brooklyn and Caribbean roots. She came up in the
            Brooklyn hip-hop scene while also constantly being surrounded by the
            sounds of Jamaican Reggae and Trinidadian Soca and Calypso. Music
            was always a centerpoint of her life, and she adds a bit of
            Caribbean flair to everything she does.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shauna's understanding of Brooklyn hip-hop goes beyond her
            appreciation of music. She grew up in the culture, and has grown up
            with some of the artists she works with.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Everybody knows each other because, before this music stuff,
            everyone was outside. When you look at the Fivio [Foreign]s, Pop
            Smokes, Sheff Gs and all of them, like, I know people who grew up
            with them,” Shauna said. “A lot of people from the hood, they're
            doing big things.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In an industry where many drill artists struggle with incarceration
            and violence, Shauna strives to provide her artists with a support
            system that they may not have elsewhere. Shauna doesn't just market
            artists, she gets them. Her empathy and understanding of the
            hardships artists face set her apart at Atlantic Records.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shauna's success so far has proven that the girl she once thought
            was “too ghetto” is now a key player at one of hip-hop's major
            labels.
