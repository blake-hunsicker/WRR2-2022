          <h1>In the Hood and on Disney</h1>
          <p>
            Young Devyn is a rising New York rapper who started to experiment
            with drill by chance. She decided to post a freestyle video on
            social media. The raw footage eventually became “Straight to It”,
            her top-performing song with more than 650,000 views on YouTube.
            While drill is often associated with violence, Devyn tries a
            different approach when working in the subgenre. For instance, she
            doesn't curse.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you listen to my song, you might be like: 'Damn, she just said
            something crazy!' but I didn't curse,” she said. “I'm trying to be
            in the hood and on Disney.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming from a Trinidadian family, Devyn started her career singing
            Soca - a popular Caribbean style of music. She was only 7 when she
            first performed at a school event to celebrate Caribbean heritage in
            New York, surprising even her mom, who was amazed by her confidence
            on stage. After transitioning to a different genre, her cultural
            background is still an important part of who she is on stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Every time you hear me rap, I always say 'Brooklyn/Trinidad,'” said
            Devyn. “So I always just make sure I represent them because they
            represented me first.”
