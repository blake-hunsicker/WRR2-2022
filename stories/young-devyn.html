          It all started when she was just 7 years old. At a school event to
          celebrate Caribbean heritage in New York, Devyn Tyson got up on a
          stage for the first time. Representing Trinidad and Tobago, where her
          family is from, she surprised even her mom, who was amazed by her
          confidence with the microphone.

        <p>
          “I had literally like an out-of-body experience,” recalled Natasha
          Mason-Tyson in an interview for Drill Down. “I was like: 'Whose kid is
          this?'”
        </p>
        <p>
          That kid became Young Devyn, first a Soca singer as a child and now a
          rising star in New York's hip-hop scene. After transitioning from the
          traditional Trinidian genre to rap, her cultural background is still
          an important part of who she is on stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Every time you hear me rap, I always say 'Brooklyn/Trinidad,'” said
          Devyn. “So I always just make sure I represent them because they
          represented me first.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Drill rap came into Devyn's career by chance, when she decided to post
          a freestyle video on social media. The raw video eventually became
          “Straight to It”, her top-performing song with more than 650,000 views
          on YouTube. While drill is often associated with violence, Young Devyn
          tries a different approach when experimenting with the subgenre. For
          instance, she doesn't curse.
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you listen to my song, you might be like: 'Damn, she just said
          something crazy!' but I didn't curse,” she said. “I'm trying to be in
          the hood and on Disney.”
