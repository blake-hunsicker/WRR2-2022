          <p>
            It all started when she was just 7 years old. At a school event to
            celebrate Caribbean heritage in New York, Devyn Tyson got up on a
            stage for the first time. Representing Trinidad and Tobago, where
            her family is from, she surprised even her mom, who was amazed by
            her confidence with the microphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I had literally like an out-of-body experience,” recalled Natasha
            Mason-Tyson in an interview for Drill Down. “I was like: 'Whose kid
            is this?'”
          </p>
          <p>
            That kid became Young Devyn, first a Soca singer as a child and now
            a rising star in New York's hip-hop scene. After transitioning from
            the traditional Trinidian genre to rap, her cultural background is
            still an important part of who she is on stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Every time you hear me rap, I always say 'Brooklyn/Trinidad,'” said
            Devyn. “So I always just make sure I represent them because they
            represented me first.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Drill rap came into Devyn's career by chance, when she decided to
            post a freestyle video on social media. The raw video eventually
            became “Straight to It”, her top-performing song with more than
            650,000 views on YouTube. While drill is often associated with
            violence, Young Devyn tries a different approach when experimenting
            with the subgenre. For instance, she doesn't curse.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you listen to my song, you might be like: 'Damn, she just said
            something crazy!' but I didn't curse,” she said. “I'm trying to be
            in the hood and on Disney.”
