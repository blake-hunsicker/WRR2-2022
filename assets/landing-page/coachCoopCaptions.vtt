So, to my gentlemen who disagree

10
00:00:17.592 --> 00:00:22.005 line:90%
tell the group why you disagree
with what Eric Adams said.

11
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.331 line:90%
- I very much disagree because
some rappers are on the grind

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.696 line:90%
and they don't even talk about violence,
like, most of the time.

13
00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.929 line:90%
- If drill music wasn't here,
people would still be kidnapping.

14
00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:36.324 line:90%
People would still be selling drugs.

15
00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:38.312 line:90%
People would still be joining gangs.

16
00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:39.881 line:90%
People would still be shooting each other.

17
00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.777 line:90%
- The only reason people think drill rap is bad
is because they only listen to the bad side of it.

18
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.394 line:90%
To be honest, you don't really want
to listen to no love songs all the time.

19
00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:51.549 line:90%
So when someone's talking about something
interesting, like killing or something ...

20
00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:55.862 line:90%
it's entertaining, let's be honest.
It's kind of entertaining.

21
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:59.615 line:90%
- All these young folks get into
drill rap so they can make money.

22
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.234 line:90%
So if Eric Adams wanted to address the issue

23
00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.065 line:90%
I think that he should focus on how can he get jobs

24
00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:11.007 line:90%
into the hands of these young folks,
who only are trying to make a dollar.

25
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.914 line:90%
Well, trying to make millions.

26
00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:13.999 line:90%
- That's a good point.
