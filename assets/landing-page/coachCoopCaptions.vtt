Everybody know who Eric Adams is?

3
00:00:03.442 --> 00:00:05.653
- Who Eric Adams is?
- Yeah, who's Eric Adams?

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.410
- He's the mayor.

5
00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:07.968
- Alright, say it again, Jabrill.

6
00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:10.765
- Eric Adams is the mayor.
- The mayor of what? Chicago?

7
00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:12.069
- New York City

8
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.016
- He's the New York City mayor, right.

9
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.024
So, to my gentlemen who disagree

10
00:00:17.592 --> 00:00:22.005
tell the group why you disagree
with what Eric Adams said.

11
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.331
- I very much disagree because
some rappers are on the grind

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.696
and they don't even talk about violence,
like, most of the time.

13
00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.929
- If drill music wasn't here,
people would still be kidnapping.

14
00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:36.324
People would still be selling drugs.

15
00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:38.312
People would still be joining gangs.

16
00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:39.881
People would still be shooting each other.

17
00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:43.777
- The only reason people think drill rap is bad
is because they only listen to the bad side of it.

18
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.394
To be honest, you don't really want
to listen to no love songs all the time.

19
00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:51.549
So when someone's talking about something
interesting, like killing or something ...

20
00:00:52.757 --> 00:00:55.862
it's entertaining, let's be honest.
It's kind of entertaining.

21
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:59.615
- All these young folks get into
drill rap so they can make money.

22
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.234
So if Eric Adams wanted to address the issue

23
00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.065
I think that he should focus on how can he get jobs

24
00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:11.007
into the hands of these young folks,
who only are trying to make a dollar.

25
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.914
Well, trying to make millions.

26
00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:13.999
- That's a good point.

27
00:01:14.212 --> 00:01:15.483
